# Image inclusion test

This is a readme file testing images references:

## Absolute path

This example uses an absolute path. You can argue that this is 
relative if you want, relative to the root of the git repository.

![This is an image](/formats/image/success.jpg)
 
## Relative path

This example includes an image that can be found relative to the
location of this markdown file.

![This is an image](images/success.jpg)
